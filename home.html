		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Road transport corporation in Telangana State was first established as NSRRTD (Nizam State Rail & Road Transport Department), a wing of Nizam State Railway in the erstwhile Hyderabad State, in 1932, with 27 buses and 166 employees. Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) was established on 11 January 1958 in pursuance of the Road Transport Corporations Act 1950. Consequent upon bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh state into Telangana and residual Andhra Pradesh, TSRTC operated as a separate entity from 03.06.2015. The Government of Telangana has subsequently established Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC), on 27.03.2016, under the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950.
			TSRTC has three zones: Hyderabad Rural (HR), Greater Hyderabad (GHz), and Karimnagar (KRMR). It is further subdivided into 11 regions and 25 divisions. It has a fleet of 9,232 buses,[4] of which around 2,822 are hired vehicles. TSRTC buses undertake operations on 36,593 routes.
